This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.\r\n\r\n_This course is not an introduction to CFD, nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 412 which introduce CFD concepts._\r\n\r\n## Access to Fluent\r\nWe will meet in an EWS computer lab which has ANSYS/Fluent installed already.  ANSYS 14.5.7 is available in the Windows labs, while the Linux labs currently support ANSYS 12.1.1.  You can purchase an academic license for ANSYS from the campus [Webstore](https://webstore.illinois.edu/).\r\n\r\nAccess is also available using the [CITRIX](https://citrix.engr.illinois.edu/) client (14.5.7) or the [nxclient](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/remote-connections/using-linux-apps-remotely-x-forwarding) with X-forwarding (12.1.1).\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-53962544-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
