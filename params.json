{"name":"Fluent-Sp15","tagline":"CSE Training Workshops in Engineering Software","body":"## A Short Course for Engineers\r\n##### April 6, 9, 13, 16, 20, 23 (Mon/Thu) • 4–6 p.m. • MEL 1001\r\n\r\n[ANSYS Fluent](http://www.ansys.com/Products/Simulation+Technology/Fluid+Dynamics/Fluid+Dynamics+Products/ANSYS+Fluent) is a popular engineering computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package.  This short course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the interface and modeling through engineering exercises and physical models.  (This course is not a comprehensive introduction to CFD nor is it intended to replace courses such as ME 412 which introduce CFD concepts.)\r\n\r\nThis course will be offered in April 2015 by [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu/) for a fee of $200, intended to recover costs of course development and delivery.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/cse-ansys-fluent-cfd-workshop-tickets-15757883253?ref=ebtnebregn\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=15757883253\" alt=\"Eventbrite - CSE ANSYS Fluent CFD Workshop\" /></a>\r\n\r\n## Access to Fluent\r\nWe will meet in an EWS computer lab which has ANSYS/Fluent installed already.  ANSYS 15 is available in the Windows labs.  You can also purchase an academic license for ANSYS from the campus [Webstore](https://webstore.illinois.edu/) if you are interested in a personal copy.\r\n\r\nAccess is also available using the [CITRIX](https://citrix.engr.illinois.edu/) client (14.5.7) or the [nxclient](http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/lab-information/remote-connections/using-linux-apps-remotely-x-forwarding) with X-forwarding (12.1.1).\r\n\r\n## Topics\r\n- Outline & Interface\r\n- Workflow\r\n- Postprocessing\r\n- Job Processing/Solver\r\n- Meshing & Mesh Conditioning\r\n- Loading & Analysis\r\n- Material, Yield, & Fracture Models\r\n- Section Properties/Composite Objects\r\n- Dynamic/Contact FEA\r\n- Batch Programming/Transient Solver\r\n- Coupling Physics\r\n- Command Line Interface/Python Scripting","google":"UA-53962544-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
